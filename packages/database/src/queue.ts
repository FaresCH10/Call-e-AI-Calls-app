/**
 * Durable job queue on Postgres, claimed with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.
 *
 * Why not Redis/BullMQ by default: Dial already requires Postgres, and phone
 * work must survive a process restart. Putting the queue in the same database
 * as the tasks means claiming a job and recording its effect happen against one
 * system, so a crash between "job taken" and "call recorded" cannot leave the
 * two disagreeing. A Redis driver is used instead when REDIS_URL is set.
 *
 * Delivery is at-least-once. That is safe here only because the thing a job
 * ultimately does -- dispatching a call -- is guarded by a unique idempotency
 * key in the `calls` table. Redelivery cannot dial twice.
